      Planting, growing and tending to crops and messing around on the farm are
      some of the fondest memories that come to mind when thinking about my high
      school experience. It was here that I first touched code in my life in the
      after school Informatics class. I distinctly remember having two choices -
      joining Cadets or Informatics, both of which ran after schools on Monday.
      I tossed up the two choices: marching for hours in the 40°C summer or
      hiding inside an airconditioned room learning how to code (I chose the
      latter of course!)
    </p>

      As part of the informatics team, I went on to compete in the Australian
      Informatics Olympiad, French-Australian Regional Informatics Olympiad and
      the Australian Invitational Informatics Olympiad as well as attending the
      Summer School of Excellence. Apart from that, I was involved heavily in
      student life as a student prefect, peer support leader and library
      assistant.
