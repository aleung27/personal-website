## 👋 Welcome 👋

Howdy! Welcome to the repository for my personal website. I'm a software engineer currently based in Sydney and thought it would be fun to finally get a personal website up and running and now, a couple of months later, here we are!

The site itself is built using TypeScript, React and Gatsby and is automatically deployed through Netlify whenever a new commit is pusher to `master`. This was my first foray in using Gatsby and I found it really fast and flexible - just as promised. Have a look around and feel free to reach out if you're interested in having a chat.

## 🔧 Installation Guide 🔧

1. Fork and clone the repository to your desktop

2. Install `node` and `nvm` if they are not already present on your setup

3. Change to the root directory of the repository and run `nvm use` to switch to the version of node specified in the `.nvmrc` file

4. Run `npm i` to install all necessary dependencies

5. Run `gatsby develop` to start the development server. Alternatively run `gatsby build && gatsby serve` to serve the built version of the website.

6. Get developing!

## 🤝 Contribution Guide 🤝

It's my personal website - doubt you'll be submitting any PRs!
